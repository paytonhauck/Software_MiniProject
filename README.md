Ran with JetBrains WebStrom using Javascript/HTML
Browser: Google Chrome

Working:
- Implemented a working database through Azure Microsoft SQL Cloud Database
- Authentication through Google Sign-In
- Random number generator working to create temperature/humidity values for user

Issues:
- Issue printing/plotting data to main web browser
  -Tried to implement with documentgetElementById() , but ran into many errors
  -Print results to console to show data exists
- Issue sending data to database but able to insert non-variable values


Both Partners were new to web development and implementing the database & authentication into code.
Also, both struggled with the communication between front-end and back-end.
